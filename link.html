	<p> I come from Viet Nam. The student of University of Information Technology. I am studying computer science. The first time I have learned programming by C++,the high-level language, is very difficult. I spent more than 8 hours coding on my computer. I tried my best to do homework, included string, array, struct,..etc. In the second year of study, I intend to register courses which include object-oriented programming, data structure and algorithm. I know that these courses are very complex, but I always belive that if I try my best, nothing is impossible. Beside, my philosophy of my life is "no pain, no gain". I always belive in my own extraordinary power. Thanks for reading my profile.
